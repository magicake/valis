**VA·LIS**  <sup>2</sup>  
*ˈvælɪs*  
*noun*

> 1. Vast Active Living Intelligence System.  The hologram-projecting satellite that creates our perceived reality.  *See: Philip K. Dick's 1981 novel.*

> 2. A less cool-- but still interesting-- personal blog on topics in pure mathematics, computer science, sci-fi, and sometimes music too.


Started in May of 2019 by a bored high school senior.  The goal(s)? To...

* Better understand topics in mathematics and computer science by writing about and explaining them
* Give back by creating a decent resource for others to use
* Have an outlet for thoughts on recently consumed science fiction and music
